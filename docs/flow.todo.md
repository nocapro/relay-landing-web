Reasoning:
  ok, let's build this thing. dark mode, slick animations, hacker vibes. got it. i'll spin up the components, wire up the content, and make it look portfolio-ready.
  first, i'll create a content file to keep the copy separate from the components. clean code is good code.
  next, i'll create all the section components for the landing page. each will live in its own file under `src/components/landing/`.
  now, let's assemble them in `LandingPage.tsx`.
  the boilerplate is missing a 404 page component, which `App.tsx` imports. i'll create a minimal one to prevent build errors.
  finally, let's update `vite.config.ts` to include all the new landing components in the manual chunk for better optimization.
  ship it.
